  overrideMarkdownText: "# Project Configuration\r\nIn order for this project to
    be functional in editor or on device there is some initial setup that needs to
    be done.\r\n\r\n## Application Configuration\r\nTo run the project and use the
    platform services we need to create an application on the [Meta Quest Developer
    Center](http://developer.oculus.com).\r\n\r\nTo run on device you will need a
    Quest application, and to run in editor you will need a Rift application. The
    following sections will describe the configuration required for the application
    to run.\r\n\r\n### Data Use Checkup\r\nTo use the features from the Platform
    we need to request which kind of data is required for the application. This can
    be found in the Data Use Checkup section of the application.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"Images/DataUseCheckup.png\"
    width=\"40%\" height=\"40%\" >\r\n\r\nAnd configure the required Data Usage:\r\n\r\n<img
    src=\"Images/DataUseCheckupOptions.png\" width=\"40%\" height=\"40%\" >\r\n\r\n-
    User Id: Oculus Username\r\n- User Profile: Oculus Username\r\n\r\nOnce completed
    you will need to submit the request, click the submit button at the bottom. data
    use checkup submit\r\n\r\nTo allow sharing of Spatial Anchors the Platform Service
    Cloud Storage needs to be enabled as well. To enable this go to All Platform
    Services and then click Add Service Under Cloud Storage\r\n\r\n<img src=\"Images/PlatformServices.png\">\r\n\r\nThen
    Enable Automatic Cloud Backup and press submit\r\n\r\n<img src=\"Images/ApplyCloudStorage.png\"
    >\r\n\r\nSet the Application ID\r\nWe then need to set the application ID in
    our project in Unity.\r\nThe identifier (App ID) can be found in the API section.\r\n\r\n<img
    src=\"Images/QuestAppSettings.png\" >\r\n\r\nThen it needs to be placed in the
    Assets/Resources/OculusPlatformSettings.asset\r\n\r\n<img src=\"Images/PlatformSettings.png\">
    \r\n<img src=\"Images/PlatformSettingsField.png\">\r\n\r\n## Photon Configuration\r\n**Note,
    this is only required to play the app in multiplayer mode.**\r\n\r\nTo get the
    sample working, you will need to configure Photon with your own account and applications.
    The Photon base plan is free.\r\n\r\nVisit [photonengine.com](https://www.photonengine.com/)
    and create an account\r\nFrom your Photon dashboard, click \"Create A New App\"\r\nWe
    will create a \"Fusion\" app\r\nFirst fill out the form making sure to set type
    to \"Photon Fusion\". Then click Create.\r\nYour new app will now show on your
    Photon dashboard. Click the App ID to reveal the full string and copy the value
    for each app.\r\n\r\nOpen your unity project and paste your Fusion App ID in
    [Assets/Photon/Fusion/Resources/PhotonAppSettings](../Assets/Photon/Fusion/Resources/PhotonAppSettings.asset).\r\n\r\n<img
    src=\"Images/FusionSettings.png\">\r\n\r\nThe Photon Realtime transport should
    now work. You can check the dashboard in your Photon account to verify there
    is network traffic.\r\n\r\n## Upload to release channel\r\nIn order to have colocation
    working using the shared spatial anchors, you will first need to upload an initial
    build to a release channel.\r\nFor instructions you can go to the [developer
    center](https://developer.oculus.com/resources/publish-release-channels-upload/).
    Then to be able to test with other users you will need to add them to the channel,
    more information in the [Add Users to Release Channel](https://developer.oculus.com/resources/publish-release-channels-add-users/)
    topic.\r\n\r\nOnce the initial build is uploaded you will be able to use any
    development build with the same application Id, no need to upload every build
    to test local changes.\r\n\r\n## Headset permissions\r\nWhen you first launch
    the application a permission popup will ask to share point cloud, you must say
    yes if you want to use colocation.\r\nIf you answered no, from this application
    or another application using shared point cloud data, you can go on device to\r\n**Settings
    > Privacy > Device Permissions > Share Point Cloud Data**. It must be enabled.\r\n\r\nThe
    application should also have Spatial Data permission enabled, this can be verified
    on device here: **Settings -> Apps -> Permissions -> Spatial Data**\r\n"
